h1. Sentence Drawings in D3

Original Implementation *done by hand*!! by "Stefanie Posavec":http://www.triangulationblog.com/2011/05/stefanie-posavec.html

Really, the origianls provide skill and grace and composure. These auto-generated ones can only imitate. 

The main attempt done by: "Tyler Rinker":http://www.r-bloggers.com/sentence-drawing-function-vs-art/

I just followed along, and implemented in D3.
